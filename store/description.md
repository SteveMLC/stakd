### Version 2: Story-Driven (Alternative)

```
🌱 FROM EMPTY CANVAS TO ETERNAL SANCTUARY 🌱

You inherit an abandoned garden. Empty. Silent. Waiting.

Each color puzzle you solve breathes life back into this forgotten place. A blade of grass. A stone. A trickle of water. With every completed stack, your garden grows more vibrant, more alive.

This isn't just a puzzle game. It's a meditation. A journey. A story told through the colors you sort and the garden you nurture.

✨ YOUR GARDEN, YOUR STORY ✨

Unlike traditional color sort games that end when levels run out, Stakd gives you something permanent. Your Zen garden persists across sessions, evolving through nine stages—from "Empty Canvas" to "Infinite."

Watch seasons change. See bamboo sway. Hear water trickle over stones. Every puzzle solved is a brushstroke on your masterpiece.

🎮 GAMEPLAY THAT RESPECTS YOUR TIME 🎮

🌟 MULTI-GRAB MECHANIC
Our secret sauce: Select and move multiple matching layers at once. It's faster, more strategic, and incredibly satisfying. Master combo moves that make you feel like a puzzle virtuoso.

♾️ ENDLESS ZEN MODE
Never. Run. Out. Our algorithm generates infinite puzzles perfectly tuned to your skill level. Play for five minutes or five hours—your garden grows either way.

📅 DAILY CHALLENGES
Every day brings a new, hand-crafted puzzle. Fresh challenges keep your mind sharp and your garden thriving.

🧘 FEATURES DESIGNED FOR FLOW 🧘

• No time limits—think at your own pace
• Unlimited undo—try wild strategies
• Offline play—meditate anywhere
• Adaptive difficulty—always the right challenge
• Beautiful animations—every move is juicy
• Haptic feedback—feel every tap
• Serene soundtrack—designed for focus

🌸 WHY STAKD IS DIFFERENT 🌸

Most color sort games are disposable time-killers. Beat the levels, delete the app, move on.

Stakd is different. It's a game that stays with you. Every session contributes to something permanent. Your garden is a testament to every puzzle solved, every quiet moment of focus.

It's meditation disguised as a puzzle game. Or maybe a puzzle game disguised as meditation. Either way, it's something special.

🎁 START YOUR JOURNEY 🎁

Free to download. Free to play. Optional purchases for hints and ad removal—but the core experience is always yours.

Your garden is waiting.
