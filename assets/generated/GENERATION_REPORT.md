# Stakd Block Texture Generation Report
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Tool:** Scenario.com API (model: Stylized Isometric 3D Game Assets)

## Summary
Generated **24 block textures** (12 basic color blocks + 12 ornamental zen-themed blocks)

---

## Task 1: Basic Block Textures (Vibrant Colors)

### Files Generated
| Color | File 1 | File 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Coral Red | coral_red_1.png | coral_red_2.png |
| Electric Blue | electric_blue_1.png | electric_blue_2.png |
| Emerald Green | emerald_green_1.png | emerald_green_2.png |
| Golden Yellow | golden_yellow_1.png | golden_yellow_2.png |
| Royal Purple | royal_purple_1.png | royal_purple_2.png |
| Teal Cyan | teal_cyan_1.png | teal_cyan_2.png |

### Quality Assessment
| Metric | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Color Match | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Very close to requested colors; some variants lean orange/amber |
| Gradient Effect | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | Beautiful subtle gradients with glossy highlights |
| Clean Edges | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | Smooth rounded corners, clean silhouettes |
| Style Match | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Modern, glossy, 3D cartoon - matches current Stakd aesthetic |
| Background | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Light/white backgrounds - will need background removal |

### Best Prompts (Basic)
```
"smooth gradient game block texture, glossy surface, [color] to dark [color] gradient, 
clean edges, mobile game puzzle piece, square tile, soft lighting, slightly rounded corners, 
vibrant color, 3D cartoon render, single object centered, no background"
```

## Task 2: Ornamental Textures (Zen Garden Theme)

### Files Generated
| Theme | File 1 | File 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Wood Grain | wood_grain_1.png | wood_grain_2.png |
| Stone Pebble | stone_pebble_1.png | stone_pebble_2.png |
| Bamboo | bamboo_1.png | bamboo_2.png |
| Cherry Blossom | cherry_blossom_1.png | cherry_blossom_2.png |
| Water Wave | water_wave_1.png | water_wave_2.png |
| Moss Grass | moss_grass_1.png | moss_grass_2.png |

### Quality Assessment
| Theme | Rating | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Wood Grain | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Nice wooden plank arrangement, warm colors |
| Stone Pebble | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent stacked stones, zen garden feel |
| Bamboo | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Beautiful bamboo segments, vibrant green |
| Cherry Blossom | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Adorable sakura flowers on pink base |
| Water Wave | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Elegant wave pattern, soothing blue |
| Moss Grass | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Creative earth/grass combo, playful |

### Best Prompts (Ornamental)
```
"[theme] block texture, zen garden style, [description], game piece, clean edges, 
square tile, soft lighting, slightly rounded corners, mobile game asset, 
3D cartoon render, single object centered, no background"
```

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ What Worked Well
1. **Consistent 3D isometric style** - All blocks share cohesive visual language
2. **Glossy, modern appearance** - Matches Stakd's current aesthetic
3. **Rounded corners** - Perfect for puzzle game blocks
4. **Color vibrancy** - Bright, eye-catching colors
5. **Zen theme execution** - Ornamental textures are unique and charming

### ⚠️ Issues to Address
1. **Perspective varies** - Some isometric (3/4 view), some flat (top-down)
2. **Background removal needed** - All have light backgrounds, not transparent
3. **Size inconsistency** - May need cropping/resizing for uniformity
4. **3D vs 2D** - Generated as 3D objects, current Stakd uses flat 2D tiles

### 🔧 Post-Processing Needed
1. Remove backgrounds (make transparent PNG)
2. Standardize dimensions (crop to square, resize to 256x256)
3. Extract front-facing texture if using 3D blocks as 2D tiles
4. Consider re-generating with "top-down view, flat texture" for 2D tiles

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Option A: Use as 3D Blocks (Upgrade Game Style)
- These blocks look premium as 3D isometric pieces
- Consider updating Stakd to render 3D blocks
- Would require significant game engine changes

### Option B: Extract Textures
- Use the front/top face of each block as a 2D tile texture
- Flatten colors, remove 3D shading
- Works with current game implementation

### Option C: Re-generate as Flat Textures
- New prompts: "flat square tile texture, top-down view, no 3D effects, seamless pattern"
- Would match current Stakd flat block style better

### Prompt Refinements for Future
For truly flat 2D textures, try:
```
"flat top-down game tile texture, [color] gradient, 2D sprite, no perspective, 
no shadows, seamless edges, mobile game UI element, vector style, 512x512"
```
